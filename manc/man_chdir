     chdir, fchdir -- change current working directory

     chdir(const _c_h_a_r _*_p_a_t_h);

     The _p_a_t_h argument points to the pathname of a directory.  The chdir()
     function causes the named directory to become the current working direc-
     tory, that is, the starting point for path searches of pathnames not
     beginning with a slash, `/'.

     The fchdir() function causes the directory referenced by fildes to become
     the current working directory, the starting point for path searches of
     pathnames not beginning with a slash, `/'.

     In order for a directory to become the current directory, a process must
     have execute (search) access to the directory.

     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
     of -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicate the error.

     The chdir() system call will fail and the current working directory will
     be unchanged if one or more of the following are true:

     [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for any component of the
                        path name.

     [EFAULT]           _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address
                        space.

     [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
                        the file system.

     [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat-
                        ing the pathname.  This is taken to be indicative of a
                        looping symbolic link.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of a pathname exceeded {NAME_MAX} charac-
                        ters, or an entire path name exceeded {PATH_MAX} char-
                        acters.

     [ENOENT]           The named directory does not exist.

     [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     fchdir() will fail and the current working directory will be unchanged if
     one or more of the following are true:

     [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for the directory refer-
                        enced by the file descriptor.

     [EBADF]            The argument fildes is not a valid file descriptor.

     [EINTR]            fchdir() was interrupted by a signal.

     [EIO]              An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
                        the file system.

     [ENOTDIR]          The file descriptor does not reference a directory.

     The chdir() is expected to conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX.1'').

     The fchdir() function call appeared in 4.2BSD.
