	eecchhoo -- write arguments to the standard output

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
	eecchhoo [--nn] [string ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
	The eecchhoo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
	(` ') characters and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the stan-
	dard output.

	The following option is available:

	--nn    Do not print the trailing newline character.  This may also be
		 achieved by appending `\c' to the end of the string, as is done by
		 iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that this option as well as the
		 effect of `\c' are implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
		 (``POSIX.1'') as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming for
		 maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to
		 suppress the newline character.

	Some shells may provide a builtin eecchhoo command which is similar or iden-
	tical to this utility.  Most notably, the builtin eecchhoo in sh(1) does not
	accept the --nn option.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
	The eecchhoo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

	The eecchhoo utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'') as
