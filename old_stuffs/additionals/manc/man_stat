DESCRIPTION
	The stat() function obtains information about the file pointed to by
	path.  Read, write or execute permission of the named file is not
	required, but all directories listed in the path name leading to the file
	must be searchable.

	The lstat() function is like stat() except in the case where the named
	file is a symbolic link; lstat() returns information about the link,
	while stat() returns information about the file the link references.  For
	symbolic links, the stmode member contains meaningful information when
	used with the file type macros, and the stsize member contains the
	length of the pathname contained in the symbolic link. File mode bits and
	the contents of the remaining members of the stat structure are unspeci-
	fied. The value returned in the stsize member is the length of the con-
	tents of the symbolic link, and does not count any trailing null.

	The fstat() obtains the same information about an open file known by the
	file descriptor fildes.

	The values for the flag are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of
	flags from the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>:

ATSYMLINKNOFOLLOW
If path names a symbolic link, the status of the symbolic link is
returned.

The buf argument is a pointer to a stat structure as defined by
<sys/stat.h> and into which information is placed concerning the file.
When the macro DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE is not defined (see below for
more information about this macro), the stat structure is defined as:

struct stat { 				/* when DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE is NOT defined */
	devt			stdev;			/* device inode resides on */
	inot			stino;			/* inode's number */
	modet			stmode;			/* inode protection mode */
	nlinkt			stnlink;		/* number of hard links to the file */
	uidt			stuid;			/* user-id of owner */
	gidt			stgid;			/* group-id of owner */
	devt			strdev;			/* device type, for special file inode */
	struct timespec	statimespec;	/* time of last access */
	struct timespec	stmtimespec;	/* time of last data modification */
	struct timespec	stctimespec;	/* time of last file status change */
	offt			stsize;			/* file size, in bytes */
	quadt			stblocks;		/* blocks allocated for file */
	ulong			stblksize;		/* optimal file sys I/O ops blocksize */
	ulong			stflags;		/* user defined flags for file */
	ulong			stgen;			/* file generation number */
};

However, when the macro DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE is defined, the stat
structure will now be defined as:

struct stat { /* when DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE is defined */
	devt			stdev; 			/* ID of device containing file */
	modetst			mode;			/* Mode of file (see below) */
	nlinkt			stnlink;		/* Number of hard links */
	inot			stino;			/* File serial number */
	uidt			stuid; 			/* User ID of the file */
	gidt			stgid; 			/* Group ID of the file */
	devt			strdev;			/* Device ID */
	struct timespec	statimespec;	/* time of last access */
	struct timespec	stmtimespec;	/* time of last data modification */
	struct timespec	stctimespec;	/* time of last status change */
	struct timespec	stbirthtimespec;/* time of file creation(birth) */
	offt			stsize;			/* file size, in bytes */
	blkcntt			stblocks;		/* blocks allocated for file */
	blksizet		stblksize;		/* optimal blocksize for I/O */
	uint32t			stflags;		/* user defined flags for file */
	uint32t			stgen;			/* file generation number */
	int32t			stlspare;		/* RESERVED: DO NOT USE! */
	int64t			stqspare[2];	/* RESERVED: DO NOT USE! */
};

The time-related fields of struct stat are as follows:

statime		Time when file data last accessed.  Changed by the
			mknod(2), utimes(2) and read(2) system calls.

stmtime		Time when file data last modified.  Changed by the
			mknod(2), utimes(2) and write(2) system calls.

stctime		Time when file status was last changed (inode data modification).
			Changed by the chmod(2), chown(2), link(2),
			mknod(2), rename(2), unlink(2), utimes(2) and write(2)
			system calls.

stbirthtime	Time of file creation. Only set once when the file is
			created. This field is only available in the 64 bit
			inode variants. On filesystems where birthtime is not
			available, this field is set to 0 (i.e. epoch).

The size-related fields of the structures are as follows:

stblksize	The optimal I/O block size for the file.

stblocks	The actual number of blocks allocated for the file in
			512-byte units.  As short symbolic links are stored in the
			inode, this number may be zero.

The status information word stmode has the following bits:

#define SIFMT	0170000	/* type of file */
#define SIFIFO	0010000	/* named pipe (fifo) */
#define SIFCHR	0020000	/* character special */
#define SIFDIR	0040000	/* directory */
#define SIFBLK	0060000	/* block special */
#define SIFREG	0100000	/* regular */
#define SIFLNK	0120000	/* symbolic link */
#define SIFSOCK	0140000	/* socket */
#define SIFWHT	0160000	/* whiteout */
#define SISUID	0004000	/* set user id on execution */
#define SISGID	0002000	/* set group id on execution */
#define SISVTX	0001000	/* save swapped text even after use */
#define SIRUSR	0000400	/* read permission, owner */
#define SIWUSR	0000200	/* write permission, owner */
#define SIXUSR	0000100	/* execute/search permission, owner */

For a list of access modes, see <sys/stat.h>, access(2) and chmod(2).

For a list of the file flags in the stflags field, see <sys/stat.h> and
chflags(2).

DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE
In order to accommodate advanced capabilities of newer file systems, the
struct stat, struct statfs, and struct dirent data structures were
updated in Mac OSX 10.5.

The most obvious change is the increased size of inot from 32 bits to 64
bits.  As a consequence, storing an inot in an int is no longer safe,
and file formats storing inot as 32-bit values may need to be updated.
There are other changes as well, such as the widening of ffstypename,
fmntonname, and fmntfromname in struct statfs.  Please refer to stat(2)
and dir(5) for more detail on the specific changes to the other affected
data structures.

On platforms that existed before these updates were available, ABI com-
patibility is achieved by providing two implementations for related func-
tions: one using the legacy data structures and one using the updated
data structures.  Variants which make use of the newer structures have
their symbols suffixed with $INODE64.  These $INODE64 suffixes are auto-
matically appended by the compiler tool-chain and should not be used
directly.

Platforms that were released after these updates only have the newer
variants available to them.  These platforms have the macro
DARWINFEATUREONLY64BITINODE defined.

The DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE macro should not be set directly.
Instead, developers should make use of the DARWINNO64BITINODE or
DARWINUSE64BITINODE macros when the default variant is not desired.
The following table details the effects of defining these macros for dif-
ferent deployment targets.

	DARWINFEATUREONLY64BITINODE not deined
	-------------------------+-------------------------------
	Deployment Target

	user defines:  |   < 10.5  10.5    > 10.5
	-------------------------+-------------------------------
	(none)|   32-bit 32-bit   64-bit
	DARWINNO64BITINODE  |   32-bit 32-bit   32-bit
	DARWINUSE64BITINODE |   32-bit 64-bit   64-bit

	(none)| 64-bit-only
	DARWINNO64BITINODE  |   (error)
	DARWINUSE64BITINODE | 64-bit-only
	-------------------------+-------------------------------

32-bit  32-bit inode values are enabled, and the legacy struc-
tures involving the inot type are in use.  The macro
DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE is not defined.

64-bit  64-bit inode values are enabled, and the expanded
	structures involving the inot type are in use.  The
	macro DARWINFEATURE64BITINODE is defined, and
	loader symbols will contain the $INODE64 suffix.

64-bit-only  Like 64-bit, except loader symbols do not have the
	$INODE64 suffix.

(error) A compile time error is generated.

Due to the increased benefits of the larger structure, it is highly rec-
ommended that developers not define DARWINNO64BITINODE and make use
of DARWINUSE64BITINODE when targeting Mac OSX 10.5.

In addition to the $INODE64 suffixed symbols, variants suffixed with 64
are also available for related functions.  These functions were provided
as a way for developers to use the updated structures in code that also
made use of the legacy structures.  The enlarged stat structures were
also prefixed with 64 to distinguish them from their legacy variants.
These functions have been deprecated and should be avoided.


RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, a value
of -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

COMPATIBILITY
Previous versions of the system used different types for the stdev,
stuid, stgid, strdev, stsize, stblksize and stblocks fields.

ERRORS
The fstat() system call will fail if:

	[EBADF]		fildes is not a valid open file descriptor.
	[EFAULT]	Sb points to an invalid address.
	[EIO]		An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to the
				file system.

The lstat() and stat() system calls will fail if:

	[EACCES]	Search permission is denied for a component of the
				path prefix.
	[EFAULT]	Sb or name points to an invalid address.
	[EIO]		An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to
				the file system.
	[ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating
				the pathname.  This is taken to be indicative of a
				looping symbolic link.
	[ENAMETOOLONG]A component of a pathname exceeds {NAMEMAX} characters,
				or an entire path name exceeds {PATHMAX} characters.
	[ENOENT]	The named file does not exist.
	[ENOTDIR]	A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

The fstat(), lstat(), and stat() system calls will fail if:

	[EOVERFLOW]	The file size in bytes or the number of blocks allo-
				cated to the file or the file serial number cannot be
				represented correctly in the structure pointed to by buf.

In addition to the errors returned by the stat() and lstat(), fstatat()
may fail if:

	[EBADF]		The path argument does not specify an absolute path
				and the fd argument is neither ATFDCWD nor a valid
				file descriptor open for searching.

	[EINVAL]	The value of the flag argument is not valid.

	[ENOTDIR]	The path argument is not an absolute path and fd is
				neither ATFDCWD nor a file descriptor associated with
				a directory.


CAVEATS
	The file generation number, stgen, is only available to the super-user.
	The fields in the stat structure currently marked stspare1, stspare2,
	and stspare3 are present in preparation for inode time stamps expanding
	to 64 bits.  This, however, can break certain programs that depend on the
	time stamps being contiguous (in calls to utimes(2)).

TRANSITIONAL DESCRIPTION (NOW DEPRECATED)
	The fstat64, lstat64 and stat64 routines are equivalent to their corre-
	sponding non-64-suffixed routine, when 64-bit inodes are in effect.  They
	were added before there was support for the symbol variants, and so are
	now deprecated.  Instead of using these, set the DARWINUSE64BITINODE
	macro before including header files to force 64-bit inode support.

	The stat64 structure used by these deprecated routines is the same as the
	stat structure when 64-bit inodes are in effect (see above).

BUGS
	Applying fstat to a socket (and thus to a pipe) returns a zero'd buffer,
	except for the blocksize field, and a unique device and inode number.
