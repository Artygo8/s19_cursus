# cpp_builder

generates cpps, hpps, main, Makefile with given ClassNames.

## Example Usage

First change the OWNER variable with your school pseudo (line 8) default school is 19 but you can change it.

to generate cpp files templates :
Makefile - main.cpp - Zombie.cpp - Zombie.hpp - ZombieHorde.cpp - ZombieHorde.hpp

```bash
$> git clone https://github.com/Artygo8/cpp_builder.git
$> mkdir example
$> cd example
$> python ../cpp_builder Zombie ZombieHorde
```

(use 'python3' instead of 'python' if not sure)

# Troubleshooting

Be aware that it wont overwrite (and wont work at all) if there already is a main in your directory.
So just delete or move it while using the cpp_builder.

This builder uses python3.
