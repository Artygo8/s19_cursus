# Libft Mini Tester

This tester is really simple and coded following the norm. Yet, it is often failed... To launch it, just:

```bash
./libft_mini_tester.sh
```

The default path is __**../libft**__. To change it, just change the line 10 of the _*libft_mini_tester.sh*_ and the include in the _*mini_libft_tester.h*_.
