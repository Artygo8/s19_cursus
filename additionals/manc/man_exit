exit -- perform normal program termination

#include <stdlib.h>

void	exit(int status);

DESCRIPTION
	The exit() functions terminate a process.

	Before termination, exit() performs the following functions in the order
	listed:

		1.	Call the functions registered with the atexitit(3) function, in the
			reverse order of their registration.
		2.	Flush all open output streams.
		3.	Close all open streams.
		4.	Unlink all files created with the tmpfile(3) function.

	The C Standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (``ISO C99'')) defines the values 0,
	EXITSUCCESS, and EXITFAILURE as possible values of status.  Cooperating
	processes may use other values; in a program which might be called by a
	mail transfer agent, the values described in sysexitits(3) may be used to
	provide more information to the parent process.

	Note that exit() does nothing to prevent bottomless recursion should a
	function registered using atexitit(3) itself call exit().


RETURN VALUE
	The exit() functions never return.
