    Args:
        y: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        x: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion m * n.
        theta: has to be a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.

    Returns:
        A numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1, containing the results of
   the formula for all j.
        None if y, x, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
